# AI Project – Resume Screening Agent

## Problem
Recruiters manually screen hundreds of resumes, which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and biased.

## Solution
This project is an AI-powered resume screening system that:
- Takes a Job Description and Resume as input
- Scores candidate fit
- Highlights strengths and gaps
- Suggests next steps (shortlist / reject)

## How it Works
1. User uploads resume
2. Job description is provided
3. AI analyzes both inputs
4. Structured score and feedback is generated

## Tools & Tech
- n8n (workflow automation)
- LLM (OpenAI / Gemini)
- Webhooks
- Frontend UI

## Why This Project
Built to demonstrate product thinking, automation design, and real-world AI use cases for hiring.
