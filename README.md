# Recruit AI – Resume Screening Agent

## Overview
Recruit AI is an AI-powered resume screening system designed to help recruiters evaluate candidates faster and more consistently.

The system analyzes a candidate’s resume against a job description and produces a structured fit score along with strengths and gaps.

---

## Problem Statement
Recruiters often spend hours manually screening resumes. This process is:
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent across evaluators
- Difficult to scale

---

## Solution
Recruit AI automates the initial screening process by:
- Comparing resumes with job descriptions
- Generating an AI-based fit score
- Highlighting key strengths and gaps
- Recommending next steps (shortlist or reject)

---

## How It Works
1. Resume is provided as input
2. Job description is added
3. AI analyzes both inputs
4. Structured evaluation is generated
